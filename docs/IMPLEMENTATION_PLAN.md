# Heare Memory Global Service - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for the Heare Memory Global Service. This plan is **provisional** and will be revised as we make progress through Phases 1 and 2, incorporating lessons learned and adjustments based on implementation realities.

## Project Context

The Heare Memory Global Service implements the "global" tier of a three-tier memory architecture:
- **Session**: Task-specific, may not persist beyond session
- **Project**: Curated by humans/agents, project-specific (AGENTS.md concept)
- **Global**: Cross-project concepts, multi-agent accessible, implicit interaction model

This project focuses **exclusively** on the global memory service implementation.

## Implementation Philosophy

- **Autonomous Execution**: Each issue is designed for independent agent execution
- **Clear Exit Criteria**: Every task has specific, measurable completion conditions
- **Security First**: Path validation and input sanitization throughout
- **Git-Native**: All operations backed by git commits for full audit trail
- **API-Driven**: RESTful interface following OpenAPI specifications

## Notes on Plan Evolution

This implementation plan is **provisional** and will be updated based on:

3. **Integration Needs**: Requirements that emerge from real-world usage
4. **Resource Constraints**: Time and complexity adjustments based on progress
5. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Changes in requirements or priorities

**Plan Revision Process**:
- After Phase 1 completion: Review and adjust Phase 2 and 3 plans
- After Phase 2 completion: Finalize Phase 3 and review Phase 4-5 plans
- Continuous: Update individual issues based on implementation learnings

**Key Decision Points**:
- Semantic search implementation approach (Phase 3+)
- Implicit observation pipeline design (Phase 4+)
- Multi-agent coordination mechanisms (Phase 5+)
- Deployment architecture and scaling strategy (Phase 5)

This plan provides a solid foundation while maintaining flexibility for evolution as we gain implementation experience.
