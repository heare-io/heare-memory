# Heare Memory Global Service - Agent Development Guide

## Project Overview

The Heare Memory Global Service implements the "global" tier of a three-tier memory architecture designed for multi-agent environments. This service provides persistent, git-backed storage for cross-project concepts and knowledge that should be accessible by multiple agent instances.

### Memory Architecture Context

This project focuses exclusively on **global memory** within a three-tier system:

- **Session**: Task-specific, may not persist beyond session (handled by agent harnesses)
- **Project**: Curated by humans/agents, project-specific (AGENTS.md concept, stored with projects)
- **Global**: Cross-project concepts, multi-agent accessible, **this service**

## Core Principles

### 1. Git-Native Storage
- All memory operations backed by git commits for full audit trail
- Every write creates a commit with proper attribution
- Push operations with retry logic and conflict resolution
- Repository serves as single source of truth

### 2. RESTful Interface
- Clean HTTP API following OpenAPI specifications
- Consistent error responses with structured format
- Proper HTTP status codes and headers
- Self-documenting via `/docs` and `/schema` endpoints

### 3. Autonomous Operation
- Service starts with comprehensive validation of dependencies
- Graceful degradation to read-only mode when appropriate
- External tool detection with helpful error messages
- No human intervention required for normal operations

### 4. Multi-Agent Safety
- Atomic operations prevent corruption during concurrent access
- Read-only mode when authentication unavailable
- Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- Consistent behavior across different agent instances

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with pytest and asyncio
- **Linting**: Ruff for code quality and formatting
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks on every commit
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with mypy validation
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public interfaces

### Architecture Patterns
- **Async First**: All I/O operations use async/await
- **Dependency Injection**: Configuration via environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Structured exceptions with context
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear module boundaries and responsibilities

### Git Workflow
- **Feature Branches**: Develop features in isolated branches
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit represents a complete, working change
- **Descriptive Messages**: Commit messages explain both what and why
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated quality checks prevent broken commits

```

## API Design

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Service health and configuration status
- `GET /memory/{path}` - Retrieve memory node content
- `PUT /memory/{path}` - Create or update memory node
- `DELETE /memory/{path}` - Remove memory node
- `GET /memory/` - List memory nodes with filtering
- `POST /batch` - Atomic batch operations
- `GET /search` - Content search across memory

### Data Model
- **Memory Nodes**: Markdown files with metadata
- **Path Structure**: Forward-slash delimited, `.md` extension
- **Metadata**: Created/updated timestamps, size, git SHA
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple operations in single git commit

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Git repository for memory storage
GIT_REMOTE_URL="https://github.com/org/memory-repo.git"

# GitHub token for write operations (optional, enables write mode)
GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
# Local storage path (default: ./memory)
MEMORY_ROOT="/var/lib/memory"

# Service network configuration
SERVICE_HOST="0.0.0.0"  # default
SERVICE_PORT="8000"     # default

# Logging level (default: INFO)
LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Development Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/heare-io/heare-memory.git
cd heare-memory

# Install dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Start development server
uv run python -m heare_memory.main
```

### Making Changes
1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/description`
2. **Write tests first**: Define expected behavior with tests
3. **Implement feature**: Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Run quality checks**: `uv run pytest && uv run ruff check`
5. **Commit changes**: Descriptive commit messages
6. **Push and review**: Create PR for review

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration tests**: Cross-component interactions
- **End-to-end tests**: Full API workflow validation
- **Mocking**: External dependencies (git, filesystem)

## Current Implementation Status

- Performance optimization and caching

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Explicit Memory Operations
Agents interact with global memory through deliberate API calls:
```python
# Read memory node
response = await http_client.get("/memory/concepts/python-patterns.md")

# Write memory node
await http_client.put("/memory/learnings/user-preferences.md",
                     json={"content": "# User Preferences\n\n..."})

# Search memory
results = await http_client.get("/search?query=authentication&prefix=concepts")
```

### Future: Implicit Memory Integration
Planned implicit interaction model:
1. Agent passes conversation context to memory service
2. Service performs semantic search across all memory
3. Relevant memories surfaced as "brings to mind" context
4. Agent maintains rolling context of relevant memories

### Memory Organization Patterns
- **Concepts**: `/concepts/` - General knowledge and patterns
- **Projects**: `/projects/` - Project-specific learnings
- **Users**: `/users/` - User preferences and context
- **Procedures**: `/procedures/` - Step-by-step processes
- **Learnings**: `/learnings/` - Derived insights and patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Startup failures**: Check git installation and repository access
- **Read-only mode**: Verify GITHUB_TOKEN configuration
- **Permission errors**: Ensure MEMORY_ROOT is writable
- **Tool detection**: Install git, optionally gh CLI and ripgrep

### Debugging
- **Health endpoint**: `/health` shows configuration and tool status
- **Logs**: Structured logging with configurable levels
- **Git status**: Check repository state and remote configuration
- **Test mode**: Run with temporary directories for isolation
